## Who are we?

We're a group of Computer Engineering student at Bogazici University and united for the purpose of developing new technologies which may become a corner stone in computer science. For more information look at our [wiki](../../wiki) page.

## Project Description

This project is a social platform which people can track and trade indices, bonds, ETFs, funds, commodities, cryptocurrencies and stocks. It also gives people chance to share their ideas about investments, events and not only commenting but also rating predictions of other users. In addition, users can follow other users, make investments and predictions, search events that may have impact on prices and calculate profit/loss. The system also makes predictions and suggestions to users according to their historical data. You can reach it from [here.](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2019group4/blob/master/wiki-assets/project-description-Spring20182019_TradersPlatform.pdf)
